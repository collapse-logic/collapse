# CSL-Core

The **Collapse System Logic (CSL)** core repository.  
This repo contains the operational Python kernel, certified `.csl` logic modules, and the proof system scaffolding used for CSL compression/expansion.

## Core Directories
- `CSL-PyKernel/` — Python kernel and proof driver.
- `.csl` files — minimal logic primitives (e.g., `mini_or.csl`, `mini_neq.csl`).
- `mathematical_proof_system.py` — primary proof orchestrator.

## Usage
cat > README.md <<'MD'
